# CSRF-Double-submit-cookie-pattern
CSRF Double submit cookie pattern (Assignment 2)
When a user authenticates to a site, the site should generate a (cryptographically strong) pseudorandom value and set it as a cookie on the userâ€™s machine separate from the session id. The site does not have to save this value in any way, thus avoiding server side state. The site then requires that every transaction request include this random value as a hidden form value (or other request parameter). A cross origin attacker cannot read any data sent from the server or modify cookie values, per the same-origin policy. This means that while an attacker can force a victim to send any value he wants with a malicious CSRF request, the attacker will be unable to modify or read the value stored in the cookie. Since the cookie value and the request parameter or form value must be the same, the attacker will be unable to successfully force the submission of a request with the random CSRF value.
